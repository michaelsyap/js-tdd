TDD Todo App:

Objective:

Create unit tests for the controller units.

Part 1:

- Displaying todo items
- Creating a new todo item


Part 2:

- Filtering todo items
- Updating & deleting todo item

Prerequisites:

1. Markup

In doing TDD for front-end development, the layout development comes first. As we mentioned, in TDD, write the test first, then write the code that passes the test. In this case, we cannot write tests first for the layout since this is visual. In this case, this is an exception.

In doing TDD for front-end development, the test first applies to the code which handles the logic behind the behavior the elements that the users see on screen.

2. JS Storage & model (Go through the model & storage tests)

In this session, since we already created tests for this during our last session, we'll go through the finished product.


3. JS Template

In this session we have a code that is pre-defined, ready for integration to our todo app. Let's think of this part as a 3rd party library that's responsible to render html content mixed with the data that we want to print. This is something like template engines or JSX in react.


4. Jasmine standalone
